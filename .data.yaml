It defines a few simple syntax on top of standard SQL, with which SQL could be executed one by one. Easy SQL also provides a processor to handle all the new syntax. Since this is SQL agnostic, any SQL engine could be plugged-in as a backend. There are built-in support for several popular SQL engines, including SparkSQL, PostgreSQL, Clickhouse, FlinkSQL, Aliyun Maxcompute, Google BigQuery. More will be added in the near future.
